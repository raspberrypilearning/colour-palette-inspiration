Colour theory is the guidelines that people use when choosing colours and how they can be used together to make nice looking visuals. By understanding color theory basics, you can evoke a particular emotion, vibe, or aesthetic simply by using different colours together. A **Colour palette** is a collection of colours which evoke a certain feeling or emotion from the viewer.


There are three types of colours: primary, secondary, and tertiary colours. These different levels of colour are about how much a colour is made up of different values of red, yellow or blue. **Primary colours** have only one of these - the primary colours are red, yellow and blue themselves. 

There are three **Secondary colours**, which are made up of a mix of two of primary colours - green is a combination of yellow and blue, orange is a combination of red and yellow and purple is a combination of red and blue.

**Tertiary colours** are any combination of a primary colour and a secondary colour.
